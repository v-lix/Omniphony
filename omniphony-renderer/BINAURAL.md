# Binaural Headphone Output

The renderer has an independent **binaural output stage** for headphones: when
selected, the whole VBAP / crossover / speaker chain is bypassed and every
input channel (beds and objects) is rendered straight to 2-channel stereo
through an HRTF, with interaural time difference (ITD), shoebox early
reflections and live head tracking.

Per channel, per block:

```
position → rotate(head pose) → (azimuth, elevation, distance)
         → air-absorption low-pass (cutoff falls with distance)
         → per-ear ITD delay → per-ear HRIR convolution   (authored level, no 1/d)
         → + 6 first-order shoebox reflections (per-ear delay incl. the image's
             ITD + ILD pan, level relative to the direct: d_source / d_image,
             low-passed by the wall and by the air over the image path)
         → + shared late-reverb tail (stereo FDN, send ∝ distance)
         → mix into [L, R]
```

The direct path applies **no distance attenuation**: object and bed levels
are authored by the mixer (Atmos object gain) and are respected as such.
Distance is carried by the *cues* around the direct sound instead — the
reflections and the reverb send are expressed relative to it, so their ratio
to the direct sound falls with distance the way it does in a room, and the
air absorption dulls far sources.

Measured cost: ~0.09 ms per 40-sample block for a 16-channel Atmos stream
(~11 % of the realtime budget), reflections included.

One exception: a bed mapped to a **`spatialize: false` speaker** (the LFE)
keeps its direct-routing intent. Sub-bass carries no usable direction, so the
channel skips the whole pipeline above and feeds **both ears equally at
constant power** (−3 dB each), dry and full-range — no HRIR, no ITD, no
reverb send, and head rotation has no effect on it. Level is unity overall
(no +10 dB LFE convention), matching the speaker path's untouched one-hot
routing.

## Enabling it

Set the output mode in `~/.config/omniphony/config.yaml`:

```yaml
render:
  binaural:
    output_mode: binaural      # "speaker" (default) restores the VBAP path
    unit_scale_m: 1.0
    hrir_source: saf
    head_tracking:
      osc_address: /gamerotationvector
      format: auto
```

> **mpv host**: `ad_orender` fixes the channel count when the decoder
> initialises, so the binaural mode must be **active at boot** (in the config)
> — toggling it during playback changes the render but not the negotiated
> channel layout. Restart mpv after switching modes.

Everything below is also live-tunable from the **Binaural / Headphones** panel
in Studio and over OSC (addresses listed at the end).

Studio's 3D view follows the path that renders. On the direct path the
objects sit in the listener's cube — no room warp, `unit_scale_m` metres to
the unit, read off a guide on its edge — and the speaker layout is hidden,
since nothing feeds it (Display → *Speaker layout on headphones* keeps it as
a ghosted reference). Through the virtual room the user's room is drawn
with its speakers as wireframe cubes: the virtual speakers the cascade
convolves, metered. A measured room replaces the user's room: its
loudspeakers are wireframe cubes at their measured positions in metres,
in the room's own colour, inside the box the file states (`RoomCornerA`,
`RoomCornerB`) or, without one, a box around the loudspeakers. That box
is also the room the render pans in — the set's loudspeakers are placed
in it as fractions and the objects are warped into it, so an object is
panned among them in the room's own metric, not the user's room ratio
(#803); the room panel shows the measured room's dimensions, read-only,
and says when the box is an estimate rather than the file's. A set that
does not fit the speaker stage is flagged in the HRTF group and the view
stays on the layout that renders. A badge at the bottom left of the
view names the path and the set in force, and says *fallback* with the
reason when what renders is not what was asked for. On the two HRTF paths, while the early reflections
are on, the listening room they mirror sources in is drawn as a dashed box
around the listener, in metres at the distance scale, with its dimensions
— the room in use, grown to hold the scene when the configured one is
smaller.

| `diffuse_field_eq` | `false` | divide the HRIR set by its own diffuse-field response (third-octave smoothed, ±12 dB, 200 Hz–16 kHz) at build time: removes the measured head's tonal signature, keeps every interaural difference |

## Head tracking

Any app or device that sends an orientation over OSC works; the address and
format are free. The reference setup is the Android app **Sensors2OSC** with
the phone strapped to the headband:

1. In Sensors2OSC, enable the **Game Rotation Vector** sensor — *not* the
   plain Rotation Vector. The standard sensor fuses the magnetometer, whose
   filtering adds 20–50 ms of latency and drifts near magnets (headphone
   drivers qualify). Game Rotation Vector is gyro+accelerometer only and
   tracks with no perceptible lag.
2. Point it at the renderer's OSC port (default `9000`) and set
   `head_tracking.osc_address: /gamerotationvector` (`format: auto` handles
   the 4/5-float quaternion payload).
3. If the renderer sees nothing while `tcpdump` does, check the host
   firewall: incoming UDP on the OSC port must be allowed.
4. Put the headphones on, look at the screen, press **Recenter** (Studio
   panel or `/omniphony/control/head/recenter`). That direction becomes
   "front".
5. If the scene rotates the wrong way, toggle **Invert rotation**.
6. If it rotates about the wrong axis — the phone is strapped on in some
   other orientation than "screen up, top forward" — run the **axis
   calibration** (Studio button **Calibrate axes**, or
   `/omniphony/control/head/calibrate` with `front`, `left`, `up`): look
   straight ahead and press, turn your head to the **left** and press, look
   **up** and press. The turn gives the head's up axis in the sensor's frame,
   the nod its right axis, and the result is stored next to the recenter
   reference (`axes_quat`). `reset` forgets it. Three poses because a turn
   alone cannot tell which horizontal direction is ahead, and this way
   nothing is assumed about how the sensor is mounted.

`smoothing` (0–0.99, default 0.2) trades a little latency for pose stability.
It is a time constant, defined for a 30 Hz source: a 100 Hz tracker settles in
the same milliseconds for the same value, not three times slower;
with Game Rotation Vector you can usually lower it.

### Other sources

The setup above uses a phone, but any OSC orientation source works. For the
**Waves Nx Head Tracker** (Bluetooth LE, Linux/BlueZ) there is a small Rust
CLI — **[`nxosc`](https://github.com/mgth/nx-tracker-osc)** — that decodes the
tracker and emits the same `/gamerotationvector` feed, so it drops straight
into the steps above in place of Sensors2OSC:

```sh
nxosc run --profile omniphony --osc-address /gamerotationvector --osc-target 127.0.0.1:9000
```

Keep `head_tracking.osc_address: /gamerotationvector` and `format: auto`.
`nxosc` also has a `--profile scenerotator` mode to drive an IEM SceneRotator
directly instead.

## Room responses (BRIR)

A **binaural room impulse response** set is a measured listening room:
for each loudspeaker of a real array and each orientation of a dummy head,
the response at the two ears — propagation, interaural delay, early
reflections and tail included. Selecting one as the HRIR source
(`hrir_source: brir` + `brir_sofa_path`, or `brir:<path>` over OSC) renders
the programme through that room instead of the HRTF stage's synthetic one.

```yaml
render:
  binaural:
    output_mode: binaural
    hrir_source: brir
    brir_sofa_path: /path/to/room.sofa
```

How it renders:

- **The virtual-speaker path is implied.** A room response only knows its
  loudspeakers, so the programme is first mixed onto the app's speaker layout
  as a virtual room (the cascaded mode, whatever `mode` says), then each
  virtual speaker is convolved with the pair measured from the set's nearest
  loudspeaker. A channel whose label matches a virtual speaker is routed to
  it directly, without panning: a 7.1.4 stream on a BRIR measured on a 7.1.4
  array reaches the ears exactly as the measurement did. Configure the
  speaker layout to match the set's loudspeakers for that; mismatches beyond
  10° and loudspeakers shared by several virtual speakers are logged.
- **Nothing else is added**: no ITD model, air absorption, reflections or
  reverb — they are in the measurement. The LFE keeps its direct feed to
  both ears.
- **Head tracking** selects, per loudspeaker, the response measured at the
  head orientation nearest to the tracked one (yaw and pitch; the sets
  measure yaw), blended over a few milliseconds. The first 19 ms of the
  response — the direct sound and the earliest reflections — turn at once;
  what lies further into the response is computed ahead on larger blocks
  and follows later, never later than it lies into the response (within
  19 ms for reflections up to 83 ms in, 83 ms up to 0.34 s, 0.34 s for the
  tail beyond). Without a tracking address only the orientation nearest
  straight ahead is loaded: the memory difference is the whole set versus
  one orientation of it (a 12-loudspeaker set at 2° steps over 360° and
  half a second of response is some 400 MB resident with tracking, a few MB
  without).
- **Latency**: the convolution adds 127 samples (2.6 ms at 48 kHz),
  reported to the host with the crossover's for A/V sync. Only the head of
  a response is convolved on blocks that short; the tail runs on blocks of
  512, 2048 and 8192 samples placed late enough in the response to cost no
  latency, their work spread over the short blocks in between, so a long
  room costs little more than a short one (a 2 s response about 1.7 times a
  quarter-second one).
- **Conventions**: `MultiSpeakerBRIR` (loudspeakers × head orientations, the
  BBC and Huddersfield databases), and the one-loudspeaker conventions
  (`SingleRoomSRIR`, `SingleRoomDRIR`, or a `SimpleFreeFieldHRIR` carrying
  room-length responses as the ASH Toolset exports) where each measured
  source position becomes a loudspeaker. Every loudspeaker must have been
  measured at every kept orientation. Responses are resampled to the engine
  rate and normalised to unit mean direct-sound energy — the HRIR scale — so
  switching between an HRTF and a BRIR keeps the level.
- **While the file loads, or if it cannot be read**, the virtual room is
  binauralised by the HRTF stage on the embedded KEMAR set instead, and the
  load status (file, shape, or the error) is published to the control
  surface.
- **What still applies**: the head tracking, the headphone ear gains and the
  BRIR options above. The diffuse-field EQ, head radius, update lattice,
  distance scale, air absorption, reflections and reverb shape the HRTF
  stage, which a room response bypasses; Studio does not show them for a
  room, and lists the room source under the virtual-room output mode only:
  choosing the direct headphone mode over a room brings the source back to
  KEMAR, and the room's file is kept (`brir_sofa_path`) for the next time
  the room is chosen. The state snapshot's `binaural.modeEffective` says
  which path renders.

### Prepared rooms

A measured set is large, and when nothing tracks the head only one
orientation of it is rendered. The loader reads the file's geometry first,
then only the measurements the kept orientations come from: the BBC 7.1.4
set below loads its front orientation in about 0.6 s on x86, its memory the
file's own size, where every orientation takes 3.6 s and 1.15 GB. A host
can still do that once, when the room is chosen, with
`orender_brir_prepare` (see ABI.md) or `renderer::binaural::brir::prepare_room`:
the result keeps the orientation nearest straight ahead and the responses as
measured (up to 10 s past their common lead), a few megabytes, and
`brir_sofa_path` takes it in place of the SOFA file. Name it after its file
with a `.room` extension (`bbcrdlr_systemG.room`): it is not a SOFA file,
and the loader tells the two apart by content. It also carries a text of the
host's naming what it was made from, so a host can tell from the room
alone whether it is the one a file would prepare. It renders exactly as the
file does without head tracking, loads in milliseconds, and the session is
built on the room's loudspeakers from the start, so a room with more
loudspeakers than the 7.1.4 layout still renders on its own. A session
given the SOFA file itself is built on them too, from the file's geometry,
and a room's loudspeakers come before any layout a host names.

### Where to get one

- **BBC R&D listening room** ([bbcrd-brirs](https://github.com/bbc/bbcrd-brirs),
  CC BY-SA 4.0): a Neumann KU100 in an ITU-R BS.1116 room, 32 loudspeakers
  covering every ITU-R BS.2051 layout, 180 head orientations at 2°, 48 kHz.
  One `MultiSpeakerBRIR` file per BS.2051 system at
  <https://data.bbcarp.org.uk/bbcrd-brirs/sofa/>: `bbcrdlr_systemG.sofa`
  (4+9+0: 0, ±30, ±45, ±90, ±135° at ear height, ±45 and ±110° at 40° up —
  every 7.1.4 position and more, 274 MB) is the one for a 7.1.4 or 9.1.4
  layout; `systemD` (4+5+0, 190 MB) for 5.1.4, `systemB` (0+5+0) for 5.1,
  `all_speakers` (674 MB) for anything else. Loaded with head tracking it
  holds about 280 MB of responses (0.33 s each after the tail cut) and
  needs about 1.15 GB while it reads them; without, 1.6 MB, read from the
  front orientation alone.
- **IoSR listening room** ([IoSR_ListeningRoom_BRIRs](https://github.com/IoSR-Surrey/IoSR_ListeningRoom_BRIRs),
  CC BY 4.0): 24 loudspeakers in the 22.2 positions, head orientations at
  2.5°, one 1.5 GB `MultiSpeakerBRIR`.
- **ASH Toolset** ([ASH-Toolset](https://github.com/ShanonPearce/ASH-Toolset),
  AGPL-3.0): exports a set for the directions you choose from its measured
  rooms, as `SimpleFreeFieldHRIR`/`GeneralFIR` carrying room-length
  responses — the per-direction shape above.
- The University of Salford's SBSBRIR (12 loudspeakers at ear height) and
  the Huddersfield 360° concert-hall set (one source on stage) are not
  layouts: the first has no height layer, the second one loudspeaker.

## Usage tips

- **The room is YOUR room, not the scene's.** The reflections and the reverb
  tail model the *listening* room — a constant, small, dry space, exactly like
  the room around a loudspeaker setup. The mix's own acoustics (outdoor
  ambience, cathedral reverb…) are in the content and pass through untouched;
  the brain factors the constant listening-room signature out, and
  externalization actually works best when that signature plausibly matches
  the room you are sitting in. So: keep RT60 short and the levels modest, and
  set the room dimensions roughly to your actual room.
- **Externalization / "inside the head" feeling**: driven by the
  direct-to-reverberant ratio. The late tail (`reverb.*`) does most of the
  work, the early reflections add the room's geometry. Adjust **Reverb
  level** and **Reflection level** by ear — too high colours dialogue and
  sounds echoey, too low collapses back into the head.
- **Tail character**: `reverb.size` sets how big the tail *sounds* at a
  given RT60 (denser and smaller below 1, sparser and larger above), and
  the two band ratios how it decays by band — a real room keeps its bass
  longer than its treble, so a bass ratio a little above 1 and a treble
  ratio below 1 (say 1.5 and 0.5) read as more natural than a flat decay.
  All three are live in the **Late reverb** block of the panel.
- **Distance**: past ~1 m the brain judges distance mostly from the
  direct/reverb ratio, not loudness. The direct sound keeps its authored
  level at any distance (there is no 1/d on it — the mixer set that level),
  so the renderer moves the ratio from the other side: the reverb send grows
  in proportion to the distance (unity at 1.5 m, capped at 6 m) and each
  early reflection is levelled relative to the direct sound
  (`d_source / d_image`), exactly as if the direct had fallen as 1/d and
  been brought back up. Raising `unit_scale_m` therefore makes far objects
  genuinely *sound* far without making them quieter. Air absorption adds
  the matching "far sounds dull" high-frequency roll-off (bypassed within
  3 m, ~14 kHz cutoff at 10 m, ~5 kHz at 30 m).
  These cues measure distance against the room cube's surface, not as a
  straight-line radius: every point of the surface is at 1 unit, so a
  layout's speakers, which sit on it, are equidistant as in a real room (a
  7.1.4's corners would otherwise be √2 and √3 farther than its centre and
  get up to 5 dB more reverb). Only sources inside or beyond the cube read
  as nearer or farther. Direction (HRIR and ITD) is unaffected.
- **Scale**: `unit_scale_m` sets how far "1 ADM unit" is in metres. At the
  default 1.0 the far wall of the mix is one metre from your nose — try 3–4
  for a room-sized stage. The reflection room grows on its own to contain
  the scene: each half-extent is floored at `unit_scale_m + 0.35 m` (6.7 m
  on every axis at a scale of 3, capped at 20 m), so the dimensions you set
  are a minimum — a room smaller than the scene it holds has no physical
  reading. Past the 20 m cap the image-source model pulls a source that
  sits outside the room back inside before mirroring it, which keeps the
  geometry valid but puts the reflections where the wall is, not where the
  object is.
- **ITD fit**: `head_radius_m` defaults to a KEMAR-ish 8.75 cm. If
  localisation feels smeared, measure ear-to-ear width and set half of it.
- **HRTF**: the embedded measured KEMAR (`saf`) is the best generic default —
  but generic HRTFs rarely deliver elevation: the up/down cues are spectral
  notches carved by *your* pinna, the most individual part of spatial
  hearing. If elevation feels flat or the image sits too high, go HRTF
  shopping: the **Browse…** button next to the HRTF select opens the
  sofacoustics.org database (HUTUBS has 96 measured subjects under
  `database/hutubs/` — try the `*_HRIRs_measured.sofa` files of a dozen
  subjects and keep the best match). A click downloads and activates the
  file live. `synthetic` is the no-measured-HRTF baseline (analytic head
  shadow, no pinna colouration) — useful as an A/B reference.
  SOFA support is compiled into liborender by default (`sofa` feature).
- **Head-tracking reaction latency under mpv**: rendered audio waits in mpv's
  output queue, so rotation is only audible once that queue drains. Set
  `audio-buffer=0.05` in `mpv.conf` (default is 0.2 s) to cut the dominant
  term. The Studio 3D head has its own low-latency pose channel and is not
  affected by the audio buffer.
- The output is plain stereo FL/FR — no special player-side configuration
  beyond a stereo sink.

## HRTF data licensing

The SOFA *format* is an open AES standard; the *data* is not uniformly
licensed — sofacoustics.org aggregates databases that each keep their own
terms (HUTUBS is CC BY 4.0; some Aachen/ITA sets are CC BY-NC-SA; some files
carry no license at all). Accordingly:

- Omniphony never redistributes SOFA data: the browser downloads straight
  from sofacoustics.org to your machine, on demand, with a local cache (the
  app is just a user agent, like a web browser).
- Each file's embedded `GLOBAL:License` / `AuthorContact` / `Organization`
  attributes are read after download and shown in the browser (local list and
  post-download status); non-commercial or missing licenses are flagged in
  amber. A missing license legally means all rights reserved — contact the
  author before anything beyond private listening.
- The only bundled HRTF data is the embedded SAF KEMAR set (ISC license).
- If you redistribute downloaded files yourself, the file's own license
  applies to you — prefer CC BY / CC0 databases (e.g. HUTUBS).
