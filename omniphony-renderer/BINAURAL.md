# Binaural Headphone Output

The renderer has an independent **binaural output stage** for headphones: when
selected, the whole VBAP / crossover / speaker chain is bypassed and every
input channel (beds and objects) is rendered straight to 2-channel stereo
through an HRTF, with interaural time difference (ITD), shoebox early
reflections and live head tracking.

Per channel, per block:

```
position → rotate(head pose) → (azimuth, elevation, distance)
         → air-absorption low-pass (cutoff falls with distance)
         → 1/d gain → per-ear ITD delay → per-ear HRIR convolution
         → + 6 first-order shoebox reflections (delay + ILD pan per ear)
         → + shared late-reverb tail (stereo FDN, distance-driven DRR)
         → mix into [L, R]
```

Measured cost: ~0.09 ms per 40-sample block for a 16-channel Atmos stream
(~11 % of the realtime budget), reflections included.

One exception: a bed mapped to a **`spatialize: false` speaker** (the LFE)
keeps its direct-routing intent. Sub-bass carries no usable direction, so the
channel skips the whole pipeline above and feeds **both ears equally at
constant power** (−3 dB each), dry and full-range — no HRIR, no ITD, no
reverb send, and head rotation has no effect on it. Level is unity overall
(no +10 dB LFE convention), matching the speaker path's untouched one-hot
routing.

Unity stays the default, but it is now adjustable. `render.lfe_gain` trims the
decoded `LFE`/`LFE2` channels in dB before rendering:

```yaml
render:
  lfe_gain: 6.0   # dB; 0 = unity (default), accepted range -60…+20
```

Because it is an *input* trim rather than part of the binaural stage, one
setting covers every output mode — the LFE keeps its trim whether it is routed
direct to a sub, fed to both ears as above, or spatialized by the virtual bed.
It does not touch bass carried by other channels or by objects, and it is
unrelated to the per-speaker output gains.

Two things worth knowing before reaching for the top of the range. `+10 dB` is
the in-band LFE monitoring convention, so it restores that relationship rather
than inventing one; and the trim spends headroom. With `auto_gain: true` the
gain stage reduces output permanently on the first clip it sees, so a boosted
LFE transient quietens everything after it — prefer a host-side limiter, or
leave room in `master_gain`, if you run the trim hot.

A declared live option (`renderer::options`), so it is tunable at runtime over
OSC — `/omniphony/control/option ["lfe_gain", <dB>]`, or the dedicated
`/omniphony/control/lfe_gain [f32 dB]` — persisted back to the config on
change, and rendered as a control in the Studio. There is no CLI flag: like
every registry option, it is set in the config file or over OSC.

## Enabling it

Set the output mode in `~/.config/omniphony/config.yaml`:

```yaml
render:
  binaural:
    output_mode: binaural      # "speaker" (default) restores the VBAP path
    unit_scale_m: 1.0
    hrir_source: saf
    head_tracking:
      osc_address: /gamerotationvector
      format: auto
```

> **mpv host**: `ad_orender` fixes the channel count when the decoder
> initialises, so the binaural mode must be **active at boot** (in the config)
> — toggling it during playback changes the render but not the negotiated
> channel layout. Restart mpv after switching modes.

Everything below is also live-tunable from the **Binaural / Headphones** panel
in Studio and over OSC (addresses listed at the end).

## Configuration reference (`render.binaural`)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|

| `hrir_source` | `saf` | `saf`/`kemar` (embedded measured KEMAR), `synthetic` (analytic head shadow), `sofa` (personalised set, needs the `sofa` build feature) |
| `hrtf_sofa_path` | — | SOFA file used when `hrir_source: sofa` |
| `head_tracking.osc_address` | — | OSC address carrying the orientation (empty disables tracking) |
| `head_tracking.format` | `auto` | `auto` / `quat` / `rotvec` / `euler` |
| `reflections.enabled` | `false` | shoebox early reflections (externalization) |
| `reflections.room_width_m` | `4.0` | room extent, x (clamped 1–20 m) |
| `reflections.room_depth_m` | `5.0` | room extent, y |

| `reverb.level` | `0.25` | reverb return level (0–1) |
| `reverb.rt60_s` | `0.35` | broadband decay time (s) — living-room-ish, not a hall |
| `reverb.predelay_ms` | `20` | gap between direct sound and tail start |
| `air_absorption` | `true` | distance low-pass on the direct path (HF dies with distance — true outdoors too) |

## Head tracking

Any app or device that sends an orientation over OSC works; the address and
format are free. The reference setup is the Android app **Sensors2OSC** with
the phone strapped to the headband:

1. In Sensors2OSC, enable the **Game Rotation Vector** sensor — *not* the
   plain Rotation Vector. The standard sensor fuses the magnetometer, whose
   filtering adds 20–50 ms of latency and drifts near magnets (headphone
   drivers qualify). Game Rotation Vector is gyro+accelerometer only and
   tracks with no perceptible lag.
2. Point it at the renderer's OSC port (default `9000`) and set
   `head_tracking.osc_address: /gamerotationvector` (`format: auto` handles
   the 4/5-float quaternion payload).
3. If the renderer sees nothing while `tcpdump` does, check the host
   firewall: incoming UDP on the OSC port must be allowed.
4. Put the headphones on, look at the screen, press **Recenter** (Studio
   panel or `/omniphony/control/head/recenter`). That direction becomes
   "front".
5. If the scene rotates the wrong way, toggle **Invert rotation**.

`smoothing` (0–0.99, default 0.2) trades a little latency for pose stability;
with Game Rotation Vector you can usually lower it.

### Other sources

The setup above uses a phone, but any OSC orientation source works. For the
**Waves Nx Head Tracker** (Bluetooth LE, Linux/BlueZ) there is a small Rust
CLI — **[`nxosc`](https://github.com/mgth/nx-tracker-osc)** — that decodes the
tracker and emits the same `/gamerotationvector` feed, so it drops straight
into the steps above in place of Sensors2OSC:

```sh
nxosc run --profile omniphony --osc-address /gamerotationvector --osc-target 127.0.0.1:9000
```

Keep `head_tracking.osc_address: /gamerotationvector` and `format: auto`.
`nxosc` also has a `--profile scenerotator` mode to drive an IEM SceneRotator
directly instead.

## Usage tips

- **The room is YOUR room, not the scene's.** The reflections and the reverb
  tail model the *listening* room — a constant, small, dry space, exactly like
  the room around a loudspeaker setup. The mix's own acoustics (outdoor
  ambience, cathedral reverb…) are in the content and pass through untouched;
  the brain factors the constant listening-room signature out, and
  externalization actually works best when that signature plausibly matches
  the room you are sitting in. So: keep RT60 short and the levels modest, and
  set the room dimensions roughly to your actual room.
- **Externalization / "inside the head" feeling**: driven by the
  direct-to-reverberant ratio. The late tail (`reverb.*`) does most of the
  work, the early reflections add the room's geometry. Adjust **Reverb
  level** and **Reflection level** by ear — too high colours dialogue and
  sounds echoey, too low collapses back into the head.
- **Distance**: past ~1 m the brain judges distance mostly from the
  direct/reverb ratio, not loudness. The reverberant field is
  distance-independent (like a real room) while the direct falls as 1/d, so
  raising `unit_scale_m` makes far objects genuinely *sound* far. Air
  absorption adds the matching "far sounds dull" high-frequency roll-off
  (bypassed within 3 m, ~14 kHz cutoff at 10 m, ~5 kHz at 30 m).
- **Scale**: `unit_scale_m` sets how far "1 ADM unit" is in metres. At the
  default 1.0 the far wall of the mix is one metre from your nose — try 3–4
  for a room-sized stage.
- **ITD fit**: `head_radius_m` defaults to a KEMAR-ish 8.75 cm. If
  localisation feels smeared, measure ear-to-ear width and set half of it.
- **HRTF**: the embedded measured KEMAR (`saf`) is the best generic default —
  but generic HRTFs rarely deliver elevation: the up/down cues are spectral
  notches carved by *your* pinna, the most individual part of spatial
  hearing. If elevation feels flat or the image sits too high, go HRTF
  shopping: the **Browse…** button next to the HRTF select opens the
  sofacoustics.org database (HUTUBS has 96 measured subjects under
  `database/hutubs/` — try the `*_HRIRs_measured.sofa` files of a dozen
  subjects and keep the best match). A click downloads and activates the
  file live. `synthetic` is the no-measured-HRTF baseline (analytic head
  shadow, no pinna colouration) — useful as an A/B reference.
  SOFA support is compiled into liborender by default (`sofa` feature).
- **Head-tracking reaction latency under mpv**: rendered audio waits in mpv's
  output queue, so rotation is only audible once that queue drains. Set
  `audio-buffer=0.05` in `mpv.conf` (default is 0.2 s) to cut the dominant
  term. The Studio 3D head has its own low-latency pose channel and is not
  affected by the audio buffer.
- The output is plain stereo FL/FR — no special player-side configuration
  beyond a stereo sink.

## HRTF data licensing

The SOFA *format* is an open AES standard; the *data* is not uniformly
licensed — sofacoustics.org aggregates databases that each keep their own
terms (HUTUBS is CC BY 4.0; some Aachen/ITA sets are CC BY-NC-SA; some files
carry no license at all). Accordingly:

- Omniphony never redistributes SOFA data: the browser downloads straight
  from sofacoustics.org to your machine, on demand, with a local cache (the
  app is just a user agent, like a web browser).
- Each file's embedded `GLOBAL:License` / `AuthorContact` / `Organization`
  attributes are read after download and shown in the browser (local list and
  post-download status); non-commercial or missing licenses are flagged in
  amber. A missing license legally means all rights reserved — contact the
  author before anything beyond private listening.
- The only bundled HRTF data is the embedded SAF KEMAR set (ISC license).
- If you redistribute downloaded files yourself, the file's own license
  applies to you — prefer CC BY / CC0 databases (e.g. HUTUBS).
