//! Where the listener is, for clients that show what is heard rather than what
//! was just rendered.
//!
//! The engine describes each block of audio — its object frame, its timestamp,
//! its meters — as it renders it, and the sound comes out later by everything
//! buffered behind the render: the output ring and the device (the CLI, which
//! measures it), or whatever an embedding host holds (Kodi banks seconds of it,
//! and only Kodi knows how much, so it reports it through `heard_us`).
//!
//! The engine holds nothing back. It says where each block starts
//! ([`PLAYOUT_BLOCK`](osc_contract::PLAYOUT_BLOCK)) and where the listener is
//! ([`PLAYOUT_HEARD`](osc_contract::PLAYOUT_HEARD)), and a client that wants to
//! follow the sound queues the messages itself; one that wants them early
//! ignores both. Until the first heard position there is nothing to compare a
//! block with, so no marker is sent and the stream is exactly what it was.
