# SOFA test files

Small SOFA files for `tests/sofa_files.rs`, which runs both readers
(`hrir_set_from_sofa`, `BrirSet::from_sofa`) on them. The files are test data
only and are never shipped.

Except for the generated `room_corners_*.sofa` variants, the files are copied
byte for byte from those repositories. libmysofa's three larger
`fail-issue-{72,77,79}.sofa` (3.3 MB each, derived from the CIPIC database)
are left out.

## Regenerating the room fixtures

Run from the repository root:

```sh
python3 omniphony-renderer/renderer/tests/sofa/gen_room_corners.py
cargo test --manifest-path omniphony-renderer/Cargo.toml --locked -p renderer --features sofa --test sofa_files
```

The generator uses Python's standard library via `ctypes` and the system's
shared `libhdf5` / `libhdf5_hl`, version **1.10 or newer** (also found under
Debian's `libhdf5_serial` names). The version is checked before using the
64-bit handle ABI. These libraries are only needed to regenerate the files,
not to run the Rust tests. New datasets have timestamps disabled; regeneration with
the same HDF5 version produces identical bytes.

Each variant sets the global `RoomType` to `shoebox` and adds `[I][C]` double
datasets `RoomCornerA` and `RoomCornerB`. The valid corners are `(0, 0, 0)`
and `(6, 4, 2.5)` in SOFA cartesian metres. The base listener is at the
origin, giving renderer corners `(0, 0, 0)` and `(-4, 6, 2.5)`; the offset
listener gives `(2, -3, -1.2)` and `(-2, 3, 1.3)`. The spherical values are
computed from those same cartesian corners. The unsupported-unit variant
keeps the cartesian numbers but labels them `foot`.

`RoomType` is updated in place, keeping its original fixed-length storage.
Deleting/recreating it with `H5LTset_attribute_string` leaves a gap in the
dense attribute heap; the current sofar reader then misses subsequent
attributes, including the global corner metadata.

The shared `RoomCorners` variable has shape `[I][I]`, contains an unused zero
and carries `Type` / `Units` attributes alone. The own-metadata and global
variants omit it: the former puts the attributes on each corner, the latter
sets only global `RoomCorners:Type` / `RoomCorners:Units` attributes. All new
variables attach the base file's `I` / `C` dimension scales through
`H5DSattach_scale`, giving them netCDF `DIMENSION_LIST` attributes.

All original dataset values are preserved except `ListenerPosition` in the
offset-listener variant. Every write checks the dataset's element count
against the buffer length, including that existing listener dataset. The
tests compare both ears' responses against the base for every emitter and
orientation in all six files, as well as checking their room geometry.
