//! Spatial audio renderer using VBAP
//!
//! This module handles rendering spatial object audio to speaker channels
//! using Vector-Based Amplitude Panning (VBAP).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! 1. **Initialization**: Create `SpatialRenderer` with speaker layout
//! 2. **Per-Frame Rendering**: For each decoded audio frame with spatial metadata:
//!    - Extract object positions from metadata
//!    - Convert ADM coordinates to spherical (az/el)
//!    - Get VBAP gains for each object
//!    - Mix object audio into speaker channels
//! 3. **Output**: Return speaker-rendered audio samples
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use omniphony_renderer::spatial_renderer::{RendererSpec, SpatialRenderer};
//! use omniphony_renderer::speaker_layout::SpeakerLayout;
//! use omniphony_renderer::spatial_vbap::{DistanceModel, VbapTableMode};
//!
//! // Load speaker layout
//! let layout = SpeakerLayout::preset("7.1.4")?;
//!
//! // Create renderer with VBAP configuration (see `RendererSpec` for each field)
//! let renderer = SpatialRenderer::new(RendererSpec {
//!     speaker_layout: layout,
//!     sample_rate: 48000,
//!     az_res_deg: 1,
//!     el_res_deg: 1,
//!     table_mode: VbapTableMode::Polar,
//!     // …
//! })?;
//!
//! // Render objects for a frame (in decode loop)
//! let speaker_samples = renderer.render_frame(
//!     &decoded_access_unit,
//!     &spatial_metadata,
//!     bed_channel_count,
//! )?;
//! ```
