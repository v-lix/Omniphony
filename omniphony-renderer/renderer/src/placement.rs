//! Where a fixed channel goes: the placement policy, per source family.
//!
//! A fixed channel — a labelled PCM channel of a stream — has to be put
//! somewhere before it can be virtualised, and the formats disagree about
//! where their speakers are. Dolby's bed lives in a cube whose corners are
//! the speakers (`L` is the front-left corner of the room, whatever angle
//! that makes); Auro-3D states an angle for every speaker and asks for them
//! equidistant from the listener. So the policy is chosen per *family*, the
//! format the stream comes from, and has three modes:
//!
//! - **Sphere** — every channel is a direction on the listener's sphere,
//!   independent of the room: the angle the format declares for it (see
//!   `bridge_api::FormatBridge::fixed_channel_poses`), or the renderer's own
//!   nominal angle for the label otherwise.
//! - **Room** — every channel is a corner of the room model, stretched with
//!   the room ratio the way an object at that position is. Declared angles
//!   are ignored. The historical behaviour, and the Dolby one.
//! - **Manual** — the family's own layout entries give the poses; a channel
//!   without an entry falls back to Room.
//!
//! The mode only decides where a *virtualised* channel goes. In every mode
//! the family's entries still say whether a channel is virtualised or routed
//! direct to its speaker (`spatialize`) and what trim it gets (`gain_db`).
//!
//! Families inherit from [`SourceFamily::Generic`]: a family without an
//! explicit mode takes the generic mode when one is set, else its built-in
//! default (DTS and Auro-3D: sphere; everything else: room); a family without a
//! layout uses the generic layout. The generic family is also what a bridge
//! that declares no family, or an unknown one, gets.
