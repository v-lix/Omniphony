//! Live-tunable renderer parameters shared between the render thread and the OSC listener.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! `RendererControl` is wrapped in an `Arc` and held by both the `SpatialRenderer`
//! (reads) and the `OscSender` listener thread (writes). `LiveParams` sits in a
//! [`LiveCell`]: the render thread loads it without a lock, so no control write
//! can make it wait.
//!
//! Speaker position updates (via `/omniphony/control/speaker/{idx}/{az|el|distance}` +
//! `/omniphony/control/speakers/apply`) trigger a background recompute of the VBAP
//! panner.  The finished panner is stored directly via `RendererControl.vbap`
//! (an `ArcSwap`), so the render thread picks it up lock-free at the next frame.
