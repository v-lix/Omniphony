//! Delay lines: the per-speaker fractional [`DelayLine`] with a
//! linear-interpolated, ramped read pointer, the fixed whole-sample
//! [`IntegerDelay`], and the ring read [`read_linear`] the binaural taps share.
//!
//! # `DelayLine` design
//!
//! Each `DelayLine` holds a fixed-size circular buffer sized for 100 ms at the
//! renderer's sample rate.  The read pointer is fractional and ramps toward the
//! target at a capped velocity of **1 delay-sample per output sample**, so a
//! 100 ms delay change takes at most 100 ms to complete with no discontinuity.
//!
//! Fractional positions are resolved with linear interpolation between the two
//! neighbouring buffer slots. It keeps its own `a + f·(b − a)` read from a
//! float read position rather than [`read_linear`]: the two forms round
//! differently, and switching would change the output bits.

/// Maximum ramp speed: delay changes by at most this many samples per output sample.
/// At this rate a 100 ms change at 48 kHz (4 800 samples) completes in 100 ms.
