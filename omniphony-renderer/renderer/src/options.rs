//! The declared live-options registry (RFC: `docs/live-options-registry.md`).
//!
//! One [`OptionSpec`] row per live option; every other layer iterates the
//! registry instead of naming options one by one:
//!
//! * the generic OSC handler (`/omniphony/control/option` — the legacy
//!   per-option addresses stay as aliases),
//! * config persistence (the targeted persist-on-change and the full
//!   live-state save both call [`store_live_to_config`]),
//! * config→live seeding ([`seed_live_from_config`], shared by the CLI
//!   bootstrap and `Engine::from_paths` so FFI/CLI parity holds by
//!   construction),
//! * the `/state/renderer` snapshot (`options` block, [`options_json`]) and
//!   the published schema ([`schema_json`], consumed by the Studio contract
//!   check and, later, the `data-option` binder).
//!
//! `key` is the single canonical name: the `render.*` config key, the key
//! argument of `/omniphony/control/option`, the key inside the snapshot
//! `options` block, and the Studio binding id. Inside the `options` namespace
//! the key travels verbatim (snake_case) — no per-layer renaming.
//!
//! The audio hot path does NOT read options through the registry: options
//! remain typed fields on [`LiveParams`], read directly per frame. The
//! registry is the declaration + plumbing layer, not the storage.
//!
//! Adding a live option = one row of `declared_options!` (`declared`),
//! which generates its `LiveParams::options` and `RenderConfig::options`
//! fields, its default and its registry row, + the Studio i18n keys. An
//! option whose value lives inside a larger structure (binaural, room,
//! evaluation, hybrid) is a hand-written row in `HAND_WIRED_ROWS` instead.
//! The conformance net in `runtime_control/tests/live_options_conformance.rs`
//! fails when a row is missing a layer.
//!
//! Options that only make sense together belong to an [`OptionGroup`], which
//! declares what applying a change costs (an [`ApplyEffect`]: a topology
//! rebuild, an evaluation-only rebuild, …). Several keys written in one go
//! (`/omniphony/control/options`, [`apply_batch`]) are applied under one lock
//! and cost one rebuild and one notification, never one per key — so a
//! rebuild never starts on a half-written group.
