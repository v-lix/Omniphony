//! The BRIR render stage of the cascaded binaural path.
//!
//! The cascade (the `cascade` module of [`crate::spatial_renderer`]) mixes
//! the programme onto the app's speaker layout as a virtual room; with a
//! room impulse response set selected ([`super::HrirSource::Brir`]) this
//! stage takes over from the HRTF binaural stage and convolves each virtual
//! speaker bus with the pair measured from the nearest emitter of the set,
//! at the head orientation nearest the tracked one. Nothing else is
//! applied: the propagation delay, the interaural delay, the reflections
//! and the tail are the measurement. A non-spatialized bus (the LFE) is fed
//! to both ears at constant power, as on the HRTF path.
//!
//! # Streaming
//!
//! The responses are partitioned non-uniformly
//! ([`crate::partitioned_conv::nonuniform`]): their head on blocks of
//! [`BRIR_BLOCK`] samples, their tail on the larger blocks of
//! [`BRIR_LADDER`]. One [`InputHistory`] per bus carries the head. When the
//! buses complete a block, every bus is analysed once, and for each ear the
//! kernels of every bus are accumulated in the frequency domain before a
//! single inverse transform — one IFFT per ear per block however many
//! buses. The tail segments work the same way on their own blocks, each
//! spreading the work of one of its blocks over the head blocks of that
//! period, and add their share of the output to every head block. The
//! host's frames are decoupled from the block: samples are pushed one at a
//! time and the output is read from a block-sized FIFO, so the stage adds
//! exactly `BRIR_BLOCK − 1` samples of latency, reported through
//! [`BrirStage::latency_samples`].
//!
//! # Kernels and the worker
//!
//! The set stays in the time domain; only the *active orientation* is
//! partitioned, as a `KernelBank` (one pair per emitter). Banks and sets
//! are built on a worker thread and handed over through `ArcSwapOption`
//! slots: the audio thread compares, sends a request, and keeps convolving
//! the current bank until the new one lands. A bank swap is blended over
//! one block ([`crate::partitioned_conv::ConvolutionPlan::finish_blend`])
//! by the head, on the block it lands on. A tail segment's blocks are
//! computed a period ahead, so each segment takes the new bank at the first
//! of its periods to start from there on, and ramps to it over the first
//! [`BRIR_BLOCK`] samples of that period's output ([`TailStreams::run`]): a
//! part of the response follows the head no later than it lies into the
//! response. Retired banks and sets go back to the worker to be freed. The set loaded for a head-tracked listener holds
//! every orientation; without tracking only the one nearest straight ahead
//! is resident (see [`crate::live_params::BrirLiveParams`]).
