//! Measured HRIR sets (e.g. the embedded SAF KEMAR data, or a loaded SOFA file).
//!
//! A [`MeasuredHrirData`] holds scattered-direction impulse responses. It
//! implements [`HrirProvider`] by blending the three measurements whose
//! spherical triangle contains the query — the measurement directions are
//! triangulated once by the convex hull of their unit vectors, and the
//! weights are the non-negative solution of `V·w = q` normalised to one
//! (the VBAP gains of that triangle, as barycentric coordinates on the
//! sphere) — with per-ear energy compensation, after truncation to
//! [`HRIR_LEN`], so it plugs straight into
//! [`HrirSet::new`](super::hrir::HrirSet::new) and reuses the regular-grid
//! bilinear interpolation. The three *nearest* measurements it used to blend
//! (inverse-angle weights) can all lie on one side of the query, which
//! extrapolates rather than interpolates; a set too small or too flat to
//! triangulate still falls back to them.
//!
//! Every stored impulse response is **minimum-phase** (see
//! [`minimum_phase`]): the magnitude response of the measurement is kept
//! exactly, and all of its energy is pulled to the start. That is what makes
//! the set interpolable — blending two responses whose onsets differ by a few
//! samples combs their shared content instead of averaging it, and the
//! threshold-based onset detection this replaced left up to seven samples of
//! interaural lag on the shadowed ear (see `docs/dsp-validation-report.md`).
//! The interaural delay itself is supplied analytically ([`super::itd`]), so
//! nothing of the measurement's phase is needed beyond its magnitude.
