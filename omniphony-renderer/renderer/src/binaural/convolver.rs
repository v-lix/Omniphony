//! Direct-form FIR convolver for one ear of one object.
//!
//! Capacity is [`HRIR_LEN`]; the number of taps actually run is the length
//! of the kernel handed to [`set_coeffs`](EarConvolver::set_coeffs) /
//! [`set_coeffs_smooth`](EarConvolver::set_coeffs_smooth) — the set's
//! [`hrir_len`](super::hrir::hrir_len) for the engine rate — so the cost
//! scales with the rate rather than the span shrinking. The input history persists across
//! coefficient swaps, so updating the HRIR between frames (as the object or
//! head moves) keeps the *state* continuous — and a kernel change is
//! additionally crossfaded over a caller-chosen ramp
//! ([`set_coeffs_smooth`](EarConvolver::set_coeffs_smooth)): the old and new
//! kernels run over the same history and blend linearly, which is exactly
//! equivalent to interpolating the coefficients per sample, so the transfer
//! function moves without a block-boundary discontinuity (issue #155). The
//! doubled dot product is paid only during fade samples of blocks whose kernel
//! actually changed. Direct-form FIR is the simplest steady-state cost for
//! short kernels; a partitioned-FFT path can replace this if profiling on the
//! object count demands it.
//!
//! # Tap-loop layout
//!
//! The tap loop is the renderer's hottest inner loop — `len` multiply-adds
//! per sample *per ear per object* — so its shape is deliberate on four counts:
//!
//! * **The history is linear and double-written**, not a ring walked backwards.
//!   Each input lands at both `pos` and `pos + len`, which makes
//!   `hist[pos + 1 ..= pos + len]` the last `len` inputs in
//!   oldest→newest order, contiguous and ascending whatever `pos` is. The
//!   kernel is stored reversed to match, so the loop is a plain forward dot
//!   product over two contiguous slices — no wrap test and no descending index
//!   in the way of the load/store units.
//! * **The accumulation is split across `ACC_LANES` independent partial
//!   sums** (see that constant).
//! * **A crossfade is two plain dot products over the same window**, not one
//!   loop feeding both kernels' partial sums. The single-kernel loop is the
//!   shape the vectoriser turns into one multiply-add per vector; the
//!   two-kernel loop stays scalar and costs five dot products instead of two.
//!   Each lane of each kernel sees the same additions in the same order either
//!   way, so the split changes no bit.
//! * **Samples go through a block at a time**
//!   ([`process_block`](EarConvolver::process_block)) and the history stores
//!   stay out of the tap loop: the `pos + len` copies of a whole run are
//!   written before its first window is read, the `pos` copies after its last.
//!   A sample stored right ahead of its own window leaves the window's last
//!   vector load overlapping scalar stores that have not retired yet; such a
//!   load cannot be forwarded and waits for them, which chains each sample
//!   behind the previous one's horizontal sum — with 8-lane vectors, enough
//!   to hold a 128-tap kernel at the cost of a 256-tap one. With the stores
//!   hoisted, the windows of a block overlap freely in the out-of-order core.
//!
//! The block is also where the instruction set is chosen. On x86-64 the same
//! source is compiled a second time with AVX2 enabled — one 8-lane
//! multiply-add per chunk instead of two 4-lane ones — and picked per block
//! when the CPU has it; a `#[target_feature]` function cannot inline into the
//! caller, so a per-sample choice would pay a call on every sample. FMA stays
//! off: fusing the multiply-add rounds once where the baseline build rounds
//! twice, whereas plain AVX2 only widens the same operations. Both builds of
//! the loop therefore return the same bits, on every machine.
//!
//! None of this is a micro-optimisation: together they take the loop from
//! latency-bound scalar to throughput-bound. Splitting the accumulation is a
//! *reassociation* of `f32` additions, so its outputs sit at the ULP level of
//! a single running sum — which is exactly the cross-host noise the golden
//! gate is dimensioned for (`dsp_fixtures::golden::BINAURAL_RESIDUAL_GATE_DBFS`).
