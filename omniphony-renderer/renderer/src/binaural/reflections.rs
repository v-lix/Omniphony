//! First-order shoebox early reflections for the binaural stage.
//!
//! Externalization aid: an anechoic HRTF render almost always sounds
//! "inside the head" regardless of calibration — the missing cue is room
//! acoustics. This module adds the six first-order image sources of a
//! shoebox room (listener at the room centre, world-fixed walls): each
//! reflection is a delayed, attenuated, broadband-ILD-panned copy of the
//! channel signal. No per-reflection HRIR convolution — per reflection and
//! ear the steady-state cost is one smoothed fractional ring-buffer read
//! and one multiply, which keeps the whole bank cheap enough for many
//! channels on constrained hardware.
//!
//! The direct path keeps zero propagation delay (A/V sync unchanged);
//! reflection delays are *relative* to the direct path
//! (`(d_image − d_direct) / c ≥ 0`). The direct/reflected energy ratio then
//! falls naturally with source distance, which is exactly the distance cue
//! we are after.
