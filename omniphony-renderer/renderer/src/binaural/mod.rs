//! Independent binaural (headphone) output stage.

//! This is a **parallel render path**, not a [`GainModel`] backend: a backend
//! only emits per-speaker gains and cannot carry the per-ear delay (ITD) or the
//! stateful HRTF convolution a binaural renderer needs. When
//! [`OutputMode::Binaural`](crate::live_params::OutputMode::Binaural) is selected, `SpatialRenderer::render_frame` skips
//! the whole VBAP / crossover / speaker chain and calls [`BinauralRenderer`]
//! instead, producing a 2-channel (L/R) interleaved frame.
//!
//! Pipeline per input channel, per frame:
//! `pos_adm → rotate(head_pose) → (az, el, dist)`
//!   → per-ear ITD delay → per-ear HRIR convolution
//!   → (+ shoebox early reflections, see [`reflections`])
//!   → sum into `[L, R]`.
//!
//! Space scaling is a single **isotropic** `unit_scale_m` (metres per ADM unit);
//! the anisotropic `room_ratio` is deliberately *not* reused here because it
//! would distort directions and corrupt HRTF localisation.
