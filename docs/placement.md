# Fixed-channel placement: Sphere, Room, Manual

Where a fixed channel goes — a labelled PCM channel of a stream, as opposed
to a dynamic object positioned by metadata — is a policy chosen **per source
family**, because the formats disagree about where their speakers are.
Dolby's bed lives in a cube whose corners are the speakers: `L` is the
front-left corner of the room, whatever angle that makes. Auro-3D states an
angle for every speaker and asks for them all equidistant from the listener:
a sphere. DTS states ITU angles for its lower layer.

Engine: `renderer/src/placement.rs` (the state) and
`orender_engine/src/virtual_bed.rs` (the resolution). Contract background:
[channel-object-contract.md](channel-object-contract.md) ("Declared poses").

## The three modes

| Mode | A virtualised channel becomes | Its nominal position comes from |
|---|---|---|
| **Sphere** | a direction on the listener's sphere, independent of the room | the angle the bridge declares for the label (Auro's setup table, DTS's ETSI table), else the renderer's nominal angle table (BS.2051 where it names the position) |
| **Room** | a corner of the room model, stretched with the room ratio like any object at that position | the corner catalogue (the bundled `layouts/legacy/5.1.yaml`/`7.1.yaml`, then `fallback_virtual_bed_pose`); declared angles are ignored |
| **Manual** | the family's own layout entry, cartesian or polar as written | the entry; a channel without one falls back to Room |

Room is the historical behaviour and the Dolby one: in a cube `L` renders at
45°, not at ITU's 30°, because the model is topological, not angular. Sphere
and Room therefore do not coincide even in a cubic room.

A channel placed by angle (a Sphere direction, or a polar Manual entry) is
stored as the normalized position that renders at that angle on the output
in force. The speaker stage warps the room, and the cascaded binaural mode
pans through that stage, so on those outputs the pose is pre-compensated for
the room ratio. The direct binaural path reads a direction straight off the
position, with no warp, so there the pose is the plain direction on the unit
sphere. Switching between the two replans the channel on the next frame.

In **every** mode the family's entries still decide two things per channel:
`spatialize` (virtualised, or routed direct to the speaker of the same
label — the LFE's default) and `gain_db` (the input trim). The mode only
decides where a virtualised channel goes.

The Side/Back surround placement (`surround_placement`) is a room-model
detail: for a source without a back pair it moves the room corner of
`Ls`/`Rs` and of the height-tier pair above them (`Lhs`/`Rhs`). It never
moves a sphere direction or a manual entry.

The height tier (`Lh`/`Rh`/`Ch`/`Lhs`/`Rhs`, 30° over the floor speaker of
the same name) has a corner too: on the wall above its floor speaker, at the
height that makes 30° in a cube.

## Families and inheritance

The renderer knows no format by name. Its family table holds its own two
families and whatever the loaded bridge declares:

| Family | From | Default mode on speakers |
|---|---|---|
| `generic` | the renderer: the base every family inherits from, and what a stream declaring no family (or one missing from the table) gets | Room |
| `pcm` | the renderer: its own PCM input (the PipeWire sink's plain PCM; the reference WAV bridge declares it too) | Room |
| anything else | the bridge's catalogue, `BridgeLib::source_families`: a name, a label, a default mode | the bridge's |

The bridge's catalogue is read once, when the plugin loads, so its families
can be configured before any stream of theirs plays; each stream then names
its family (`FormatBridge::source_family`, a string read when the labels
change), resolved to a table entry once per declaration. The harletty bridge
declares:

| Family | Label | Covers | Default mode on speakers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dolby` | Dolby | AC-3, E-AC-3, TrueHD (with or without objects) | Room |
| `dts` | DTS | DTS, DTS-HD, DTS:X | Room (its ETSI angles serve Sphere) |
| `auro` | Auro-3D | an unfolded Auro-3D carrier | Sphere |
| `iamf` | Eclipsa / IAMF | IAMF (ITU BS.2051 loudspeaker layouts) | Sphere |

The PCM bridge carries PCM a host decoded itself. Its streams are `pcm`
unless the host names the original codec (`input_codec`), and it declares
the two families that can then name, with the harletty bridge's defaults:

| Family | Label | Covers | Default mode on speakers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dolby` | Dolby | host-decoded AC-3, E-AC-3, TrueHD | Room |
| `dts` | DTS | host-decoded DTS | Room |

A family the config names but no loaded bridge declares stays in the table,
undeclared: its settings are kept and saved back, and apply again once a
bridge declares it. Studio offers the families the renderer publishes
(`placementFamilies`), named by their label.

`generic` is also the base the others inherit from: a family with no mode
of its own takes the generic mode when one is set, else the output's
default; a family with no layout of its own uses the generic layout.

## The output's default

When neither a family nor `generic` sets a mode, the output decides:

| Output | Mode |
|---|---|
| Headphones (binaural, direct or virtual room) | **Sphere**, whatever the family |
| Speakers | the family's default mode (the tables above) |

On headphones there is no room around the listener whose corners the
channels could take, and a direction on the sphere is what an HRTF renders;
on speakers Room often matches where the real speakers stand (#569, #375,
#679). The default is a resolution, not a setting: switching the output
re-plans a defaulted family on the next frame, and nothing is written to the
config. A mode chosen for a family, or for `generic`, wins on either output.

## Config

```yaml
render:
  placement:
    generic:
      mode: manual          # sphere | room | manual; absent = inherit / built-in
      layout:               # the family's entries, speaker-layout schema
        radius_m: 1.0
        speakers:
          - { name: LFE, coord_mode: cartesian, x: 0, y: 1, z: 0, spatialize: false, gain_db: -3 }
          - { name: Ls,  coord_mode: polar, azimuth: -110, elevation: 0, distance: 1 }
    auro:
      mode: sphere
    dts:
      layout: { speakers: [ … ] }   # own entries, mode inherited
```

A config from before this feature carries a single `render.virtual_bed`,
which applied to every stream. It migrates on load into `placement.generic`
in **manual** mode with those entries — every family inherits it — so the
sound is the same after the upgrade; the next save writes `placement` and
drops `virtual_bed`. The key is omitted when everything is at its default.
Profiles carry it like any other `render` key.

## OSC

- `/omniphony/control/placement/mode [family, mode]` — `mode` is `sphere`,
  `room`, `manual`, or `inherit` to clear the family's own choice.
- `/omniphony/control/placement/layout [family, yaml]` — the family's
  entries as a YAML speaker layout; an empty string clears them.
- `/omniphony/control/virtual_bed [yaml]` — legacy, the generic family's
  entries.

All three persist on the next save and re-plan the current stream. A
family's entries are a *partial* set: one channel, or none, is a legitimate
list (only the channels named get their routing, trim or manual pose from
it), so the layout is parsed without the VBAP minimum an output layout
needs.

The `/omniphony/state/renderer` snapshot carries a `placement` block, one
entry per family of the table, keyed by name: `label`, `declared` (false for
a family known only from the config), `defaultMode`, `mode` and `layout`
(the family's own, `null` when inherited), `effectiveMode` on the current
output, `modeSource` saying why (`own`, `generic`, `headphones` or
`family`), and `layoutSource` (`own`, `generic` or `none`). `defaultMode` is
the speakers' default. `placementFamilies` lists the
families a client offers, in order: `generic`, the bridge's in its
catalogue order, then `pcm`. `fixedChannelProcessing.family` names the
family of the stream being rendered; the legacy `virtualBed` key mirrors
the generic entries.

## Checking it end to end

`scripts/placement_e2e.py` runs `orender render` on a fixed-channel stream
with a bridge, registers as an OSC client, and prints the direction of a
few fixed channels as the renderer reports them, then switches the Auro
family through room, manual and back over OSC and prints again. On an
Auro-3D 13.1 carrier extract the sphere phase shows `L` at −30°, `Ls` at
−110° and `Lhs` at −110°/30°; the room phase the corners (`L` −45° in the
cube it forces, `Ls` −90°, `Lhs` −90°/30° on the wall above it); the manual
phase the entries it sent, the rest falling back to the room.

## Engine notes

- Both channel planners key their cache on the family and its effective
  placement, compared by value against the live params on every frame (a
  short slice and a few scalars), so an edit re-plans on the next frame without
  relying on an options-epoch bump; a steady stream never re-plans.
- The display objects of fixed channels are named by their canonical label
  whatever gave the pose (a layout entry's own spelling, a corner, a
  direction), so a channel keeps its name across the modes.
- The published fixed-channel catalogue carries, per label, the room corner
  (`x`/`y`/`z`) and the nominal direction (`azimuth`/`elevation`), so an
  editor can show either mode's default for a family that is not playing.
  The `Ls`/`Rs` direction uses the 5.1 convention (±110°); a 7.x source
  renders its side pair at ±90° in sphere mode.
